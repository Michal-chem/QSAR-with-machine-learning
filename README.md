# QSAR-with-machine-learning

This code allows you to convert chemicals encoded as SMILE in Morgan fingerprints using the rdkit library and build a model using MLP Regressor, which allows you to predict, for example, the biological activity of a new chemical agents.

The input file should be a CSV file containing the SMILE codes of chemical compounds in the first column and the target variables in the following columns. To avoid overfitting, you can use the max_iter parameter.
